# SentimentAnalysis

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis of a Food Review Dataset using different NLP techniques and models. The goal is to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and compare the performance of different approaches.

Methods Used:-

1.VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, effective for short texts such as reviews. Used to classify sentiment based on pre-defined word polarity scores.
2.RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) A transformer-based model for natural language understanding. Fine-tuned on the food review dataset to improve classification accuracy.
3.Hugging Face Transformers Leveraged Hugging Face’s transformers library for pre-trained models. Applied pipelines for sentiment classification with RoBERTa and other models available on Hugging Face.
